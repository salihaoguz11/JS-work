# Programming Basics: string methods

1. Declare a variable with the value of "Hello World". Covert the value to upper case and print the converted value to the console.

2. Declare another variable with the value of "Hello Earthling". Convert the value to lower case and print the converted value to the console.

3. Create a new string from a given string with the first character of the given string added at the front and back, i.e., expected output: Bananas => BBananasB.

4. Create a new string from a given string taking the last 3 characters of the string and add them to both the front and back of the new string. The string length must be 3 or more, i.e., expected output: Scritch => tchScritchtch.

5. Create a new string from a given string by changing the position of first and last characters. The string length must be greater than or equal to 2, i.e., expected output: BoogieWoogie => eoogieWoogiB.

6. Declare a variable and assign the value "the quick brown fox" (all in lower case). Capitalize the first letter of that string. Print the result to the console.
